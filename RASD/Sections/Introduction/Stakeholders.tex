The stakeholders of our project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Municipal administrators of the city: they gave us this project in order to optimize the taxi service of the city.
\item Users: they are involved in our project because they will
use our system-to-be, in particular they will have the possibility to choose between the web application or the mobile application.
\item Taxi companies: our system will offer a mobile application for taxi drivers.
\item System administrators: they are the managers of our system.
\item Developers: they will develop the system.
\item Testers: they will have to check if our system respects all the requirements that have been identified.
\end{itemize}
