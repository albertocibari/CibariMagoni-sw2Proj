Our document is organized in four main parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduction: in this section, we give an overview of the scope and goals of our system-to-be. We also identify the main actors that will be involved in our system and give the basic definitions of some words we will often use in this document.
	\item Overall description: in this part, we try to focus our attention on constraints and assumptions concerning our system-to-be and the world around it. This section also considers some possible future implementations that could be added to our system.
	\item Specific requirements: this section is the body of our document. All the specific requirements that our system need are described here and they are associated with different kinds of diagrams, in order to create a model of the real system.
	\item Bibliography: in this part we specify the documents or books we have referred to.
	\item Appendix: here we indicate what tools we have used in this document and the hours spent on this work.
