The user should be able to make a taxi request from the web application and the mobile application. The reservation must contain the origin and the destination of the ride. The user has to specify also the date and hour of the reservation. If the values for the reservation are valid, the user can send the request to the system. Then the user will receive a notification with the taxi identifier.
