The user should be able to make a taxi request from the web application and the mobile application. If the request comes from the web application, the user has to tell the system the origin and the destination of the ride, otherwise they can be taken using the GPS of the mobile application.
After the user makes the request, he receives a notification from the system with the identifier of the taxi and the possible arrival time of the taxi.
Once the request is sent to the system, the system has to send it to the first taxi driver available, who can accept or deny the request.

\subparagraph{Functional requirements}
\noindent
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The origin and the destination must be valid [View assumptions]. They must be within 10Km from the city boundaries.
		\item If the request is made using the web application, the system shall be provided with the passenger location inserted directly by the user.
		\item If the request is made using the mobile application, the system can use the GPS position to identify the user location.
		\item If the GPS is not available, the system tells the passenger to insert the correct origin location for the taxi ride.
		\item If the origin and/or the destination are not specified (neither from GPS nor from the user insertion), the user can not proceed to send the request.
		\item If a request is not accepted by a taxi driver, it is passed to the next driver in the queue of the city zone.
	\end{itemize}
