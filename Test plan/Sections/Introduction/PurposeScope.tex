\subsubsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the test plan we have chosen in order to manage the integration tests of our system. Integration tests are done to exercise the interactions of components and subsystems that were presented in the DD. 

\subsubsection{Scope}
The aim of our project is to optimize the taxi service of a large city. 
Passengers, once registered to the application, will have the possibility to request a taxi through either the web application or the mobile application. When a request from a passenger arrives, the system-to-be will be able to look for an available taxi (through a fair management of the taxi queues) and send to the passenger the code of the incoming taxi and the waiting time. 
\newline
Moreover, our system will also offer a mobile application for taxi drivers so that they will be able to share their availability and confirm a certain call.
\newline
Another functionality that our system will offer to users is the reservation of a taxi. Users will have the possibility to reserve a taxi in advance, by specifying the origin and the destination of their journey. The reservation must occur at least two hours before the ride and the system will inform the taxi driver ten minutes before the scheduled time.
\newline
Our system will provide some programmatic interfaces for the development of additional functions, such as taxi sharing.
