In this section we define the criteria that must be met before starting the integration tests.
Referring to the documents:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The RASD and the DD must be delivered, complete and updated. 
\end{itemize}

Referring to the code:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests must be done to classes and functions and cover at least an average of the 90\% of the lines of code. Indeed, unit tests must be done in order to avoid mistakes in the phase of integration.
    \item The JavaDoc must be complete and updated in order to simplify the integration tests. In particular, public classes and public methods should have a detailed JavaDoc documentation. 
    \item The code inspection must have been done; in this way, some errors or possible errors can be avoided and testers will save time while doing the integration tests.
\end{itemize}
