\subsubsection{Software Integration Sequence}

\label{sectionIntegration}
In order to show the sequence of the integration, we distinguish into the two subsystem server and client.
\newline
In the images shown in this section, an arrow that goes from a general integration test T1 to another integration test T2 means that, before doing the integration test T2, the integration test T1 must be performed.

In particular, we want to underline that we decided to give priority to tests that concern taxi drivers; indeed, those tests will be performed before the ones regarding passengers. This choice is due to the fact that in our project the central role is played by taxi rather than passengers.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Integration Sequence}
<<<<<<< HEAD
The next figure shows the sequence of the integration of the main subsystems.
\newline
The integration of subsystems will start from the database and the server; then, we will integrate the server and the client. This choice seems reasonable since the database and the server are the most important parts of the whole system: the server manages the business logic, while the database manages the data. So, we decided to give highest priority to this two subsystems rather than the client.
