The integration test strategy we have chosen is a mixed approach; for the most part, it is a bottom-up strategy but in few cases we have used the top-down approach. 
\newline 
The reason why we have widely used the bottom-up model is that it allows to start integrating from the simplest components of the system. In this way, the complexity of the integration will increase gradually step by step.
In few parts of the integration we have preferred a top-down approach because in those cases it was more convenient to use stubs instead of drivers.
