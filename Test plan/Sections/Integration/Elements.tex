Referring to our DD, we have identified the main subsystems that are part of our system and that will need to be integrated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Client: it is formed of the components that are located on the client tier.
    \item Server: this subsystem contains all the components that manage the business logic and the creation of the web interfaces.
    \item Database: this high-level component contains all the data that have to be kept in the system.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Client}
We now list the components of the client according to their level by starting from the highest level:
\begin{itemize}
    \item WebManager. 
    \item AppManager.
    \item User.
    \item Taxi.
    \item Position.
\end{itemize}
These components have already been described in the DD.

\subsubsection{Server}
We now list the components of the server according to their level by starting from the highest level:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Registration Manager.
    \item Login Manager.
    \item Zone Manager.
    \item Queue Manager.
    \item Call Manager.
    \item DB Manager.
    \item Security.
\end{itemize}
These components have already been described in the DD.

\subsubsection{Database}
In this subsystem we have not identified any components because we do not have to develop this part; we assume that the database has been already tested and it need only to be integrated with the system.
