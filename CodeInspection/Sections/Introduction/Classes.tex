Our group has to inspect two methods of the class \textit{AdminConsoleAuthModule}: the \textit{initialize} and the \textit{validateRequest} methods.\\
This class can be found in the class file under \textit{appserver/admingui/common/src/main/java/org/glassfish/admingui/common/security/\\AdminConsoleAuthModule.java}

This class is responsible for providing the Authentication support needed by the admin console to both access the admin console pages as well as invoke REST requests.

\subsubsection{\textit{validateRequest} method}
This is where the validation happens...
