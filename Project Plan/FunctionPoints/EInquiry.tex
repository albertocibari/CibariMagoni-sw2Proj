External Inquiry refers to elementary operation that involves input and output, without significant elaboration of data from logic files.
\newline
In our system, we have identified these External Inquiries concerning the general user (either taxi driver or passenger):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Visualize all the requests/reservations done. 
	\item View the history of all the rides done. 
\end{itemize}

Other External Inquiries specific for taxi drivers are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item View the pending requests. 
\end{itemize}
These operations involve only one entity each, so they have a simple complexity: 3 x 3 = 9 FPs.
\newline
All these operations have been identified referring to the RASD.\footnoteref{note1}
