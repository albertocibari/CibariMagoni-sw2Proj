External Output refers to elementary operations that generate data for the external environment (usually including the elaboration of data from logic files).
\newline
In our system, we have identified the following External Output operations that are performed by the server:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notification to taxi drivers of a new request: when a passenger makes a request for service, the system will send a notification to taxi drivers, according to the queue algorithm. 
    \item Notification to taxi drivers of a new reservation: when a passenger asks for a reservation, the system will send a notification to taxi drivers, according to the queue algorithm. 
    \item Confirmation to passenger who asked for a request: once the system found a taxi that is able to satisfy the passenger's request, it sends a confirmation to the passenger with the taxi identifier and the possible arrival time. 
    \item Confirmation to passenger who asked for a reservation: the system sends a confirmation to the passenger with the taxi identifier ten minutes before the ride. 
    \item E-mail to users that successfully registered in the system. 
\end{itemize}
All the operations described in the section are simple operation: 5 x 4 = 20 FPs.
\newline
All these operations have been identified referring to the RASD.\footnote{\label{note1} Section "Overall Description"}
