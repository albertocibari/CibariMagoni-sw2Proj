In order to estimate the effort of the project, we refer to the COCOMO II model; the effort is expressed as Person-Months (PM):

%FORMULA
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Effort} = A * EAF * (KSLOC)^{E} = 2.49 *  * (6.519)^{a}  = 
\end{equation}


The value of KSLOC can be evaluated from the FP count:
\begin{equation}
    SLOC = FPs * 53 = 123 * 53 = 6519
\end{equation}
The value 53 refers to the use of Java as the programming language.

Since we have not implemented the software, we are not able to make any comment about the estimation of the SLOC.

During the estimation process, in order to give a weight to Scale Drivers and Cost Drivers, we have referred to the tables presented in the document:
