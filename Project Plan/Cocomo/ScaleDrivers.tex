There are five Scale Drivers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Precedentedness: reflects the previous experience of the organization with this type of project.
        \newline
        Since we do not have any experience concerning this kind of project, the value of precedentedness of our project is low.
    \item Development flexibility: reflects the degree of flexibility in the development process; for example, very high means that the client set only general goals.
        \newline
        In our project, goals were well defined by the client but not in a very specific way; indeed, they were general. So the development flexibility can be very high.
    \item Architecture/risk resolution: reflects the the extent of risk analysis carried out.
        \newline
    \item Team cohesion: reflects how well the development team know each other and work together.
        \newline
        During the project, each member of the team was assigned to a specific task; we scheduled some meetings in order to overcome the difficulties we could have and to discuss about the main topics of each task. Our strategy was effective since we have been able to accomplish every task in time and accurately.
    \item Process maturity: reflects the process maturity of the organization.
\end{itemize}

The values associated to each Scale Driver are listed in the following table:
