This document represents the Design Document of our project. Its aim is to describe the components of our system and how they will interact, and explain the choices we made about the architectural styles and pattern. 
\newline
Moreover, this document will be provided with Sequence Diagrams in order to show how the entire system will work dynamically.
\newline
Further, this document will give an idea of how the system will look like, giving an overview of user interfaces in a more specific way than in the RASD.
