This document represents the Design Document of our project. Its general aim is to describe the components of our system, how they will interact and explain the choices we made about the architectural styles and patterns. 
\newline
Moreover, in order to offer a more specific idea of how components interact, this document will be provided with Sequence Diagrams that show how the entire system will work dynamically.
\newline
Further, this document will show and describe how the system will look like, giving an overview of user interfaces in a more specific way than in the RASD.
