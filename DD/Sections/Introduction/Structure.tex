Our DD document is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction: in this section, we want to explain the purpose of this document, give some definitions and acronyms and list the documents we referred to. 
    \item Architectural Design: in this section, we focus our attention on the components of our system and how they are deployed in hardware. First, we give an overview of the main components and their interaction; then, we explain in details how they are interconnected, using a Component Diagram.
    In the end, we explain how components are physically organized, how the system runs dynamically and what are the architectural styles and patterns we have chosen for our system.
    \item Algorithm Design: in this section, we propose algorithms in order to find the best solution to the main issues of our system.
    \item User Interface Design: using the UX Diagram and referring to the mockups presented in the RASD, we give an idea of how the users interfaces will look like.
    \item Requirement Traceability: this section has the aim to show the relationships between the DD document and the RASD.
    \item References: here we list all the documents we referred to during the writing of the DD document.
