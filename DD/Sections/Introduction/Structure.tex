Our DD document is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction: in this section, we want to explain the purpose of this document, give some definitions and acronyms and list the documents we referred to. 
    \item Architectural Design: in this section, we focus our attention on the components of our system and how they are deployed in hardware. First, we give an overview of the main components and their interaction; then, we explain in details how they are interconnected, using a Component Diagram.
    In the end, we explain how components are physically organized, how the system runs dynamically and what are the architectural styles and patterns we chose for our system.
    \item Algorithm Design: in this section, we propose algorithms in order to find the best solution of the main issues of our system.
    \item User Interface Design:
    \item Requirement Traceability:
    \item References: here we list all the documents we referred to.
