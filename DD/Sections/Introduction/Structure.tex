Our DD document is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction: in this section, we want to explain the purpose of this document, give some definitions and acronyms and list the documents we referred to. 
    \item Architectural Design: in this section, we focus our attention on the components of our system. First, we give an overview of the main components and their interaction; then, we explain in details how they are interconnected, using a Component Diagram.
    In the end, we explain how components are physically organized, how the system runs dynamically and what are the architectural styles and patterns we chose for our system.
