\subparagraph{Zone Manager}
This component coordinates all the zones the city is divided in.
\begin{itemize}
    \item It creates the queues of every zone.
    \item It receives the taxi drivers positions and it is able to compute the zone in which the taxi is.
    \item When a taxi driver leaves a zone, the taxi driver must be removed from the previous queue in which he was, so the ZoneManager notifies the QueueManager, telling him the new zone of the taxi and the associated queue.
\end{itemize}
